# Mission Control

## Running
`npm install && grunt install && gulp`
Notice gulp alone should do the trick

If you are having issues, try installing gulp in global scope

`sudo npm -g install gulp`
**Using gulp because grunt is fat and ugly**

### Other configurations
`gulp build` to build only
`gulp webserver` to host built files
